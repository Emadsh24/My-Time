![productivity_timer](https://github.com/Emadsh24/My-Time/blob/main/timer.jpg "productivity_timer")


## Getting Started

 build an app that will help you set the time intervals that work for you, and measure your work and break time. In fact, you'll be building a productivity app containing a countdown that tells you your remaining working or break time, with an animation on the screen. On a second screen, you'll also be able to set the duration of your work time, short break, and long breaks, and save them on your device.
